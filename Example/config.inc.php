/**
 * Configuration for: Database
 * This is the place where you define your database credentials, type etc.
 *
 * database host, usually it's "127.0.0.1" or "localhost", some servers also need port info, like "127.0.0.1:8080"
 * define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
 * name of the database. please note: database and database table are not the same thing!
 * define('DB_NAME', 'login');
 * user for your database. the user needs to have rights for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT
 * By the way, it's bad style to use "root", but for development it will work
 * define('DB_USER', 'root');
 * The password of the above user
 * define('DB_PASS', 'xxx');
 * define('DB_PREFIX', 'prefix_'); or NULL
